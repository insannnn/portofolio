[Project 1 - Student Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/insannnn/student_prediction_modeling.git)

## Overview:
This project leverages machine learning to empower students with data-driven insights for selecting courses and lecturers that align with their academic goals. The core objective is to improve student outcomes by predicting how different instructor-course combinations might influence a studentâ€™s performance.

## Key Features:

### Personalized Instructor Recommendations:
Students input their name, desired course, and target grade. The system predicts their expected performance with each available lecturer and recommends the most suitable instructor to help them achieve their academic goals.

### Machine Learning Model:
Utilized a Random Forest Regressor trained on historical student performance data, including grades, instructors, courses, and additional academic features. The model predicts the potential final grade for a student under different instructors.

### Web Application Integration:
Developed a user-friendly Django-based web application where students can interact with the system. The backend integrates with SQLAlchemy for efficient database querying and data manipulation.

### Tools & Technologies:
Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Django, SQLAlchemy, HTML/CSS (for UI)

[Project 2 - Analysis The Most Efficient Coffee Machine](https://github.com/insannnn/machineCoffe)
1. Analyzed coffee machine performance across different stores to determine the most efficient model
   based on brewing speed, energy consumption, and cost-effectiveness
2. Worked with a structured dataset, cleaning and preprocessing data for accurate analysis.
3. Used statistical methods and visualizations to uncover trends in machine efficiency and identify key performance factors
4. Provided data-backed recommendations on the best-performing coffee machines, helping businesses optimize operations

[Project 3 - Forecasting Korean Food Demand In Indonesia Using Time-series](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c3YoSeoO-AmnO0UQ3zK4HscuWPH-q3Fp/view)

This work, created as part of a campus assignment, utilized Google Trends data to analyze the rising interest in Korean food across Indonesia. The objective? To help businesses make informed decisions about where to open their Korean food store. 

Using time-series forecasting and the Exponential Smoothing model, I predicted trends for the next 5 years. Moreover, as for visualization I used Matplotlib.
ðŸ“ˆ Key takeaways:
- Korean food trend has fluctuated over the past 13 years 
- Provinces like DKI Jakarta, Central Java, East Java, and West Nusa Tenggara show significant potential for Korean food businesses.
- Other provinces show declining or stagnant trends for Korean food.
